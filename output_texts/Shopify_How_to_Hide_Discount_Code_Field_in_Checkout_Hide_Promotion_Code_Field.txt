In this video, I will show you how to hide the discount code field in Shopify checkout. This is particularly useful if you don't plan to offer discount codes to your site or you're running your store in such a way that discount codes are applied automatically. So to hide the discount code field, first we need to log into Shopify admin account and then click on discounts. Right here, look for any discounts which are currently set as active and have a method of code. The other ones that you should have here are basically automatics, we don't have to worry about those. So let's open the first one, 20% off and then select deactivate. And now let's confirm the activation. Okay, so the discount code has expired. Now allow a few minutes for the changes to update in the system and then go back to Shopify checkout and try refreshing it. Yeah, looks like we need to wait three more minutes. While recording this video, it took about 10 minutes for the change to update in the system. And as you can see right now, the discount code field is now hidden. So that's all I want to show you in this video. I hope you found helpful. If you want more Shopify tutorials, please subscribe to my channel. Thank you.
